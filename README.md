# Jet's Island

Setetup steps for next js application from scratch and online business "Jet's Island" presentation.

## Architecture

This section will include all steps and packages needed to setup the codebase.

### Installation

First, the next.js project needs to be initialized. Make sure you have node installed locally, then run the create-next-app command with the --ts flag, for TypeScript. You can also add the . if you wish to install in the current folder, instead of creating a new one.

```
npx create-next-app@latest --ts .
```

### Engine locking

First, we will define the fact that this project is designed to be built and run with yarn (the default for create-next-app, instead of npm). We already initialized the project with yarn during the initial step, and a .yarnlock file was autogenerated.

##### .npmrc

We will create a .npmrc file, where we specify that the engine that we defined (yarn / npm) must strictly be used when workgin with this project

```
engine-strict=true
```

##### .nvmrc

We will create a .nvmrc to clarify which version of node we are using

```
v16.13.1
```

Depending on your needs, you may need to use an older node version (e.g. if you want to deploy on something like vercel, you may need to use a speciffic or older node version)

##### "engines" field to package.json

Add the following engine to the package.json file; with this engine locking in place, if someone tries to run 'npm install', which could create a package.lock file and cause conflicts, an error will be thrown.

### Eslint

By default, eslint also come preconfigured in the next app, so you can already run `yarn lint` and it will work, but we do want to add more configurations to make it a bit more strict.

The .eslint.json file already extends next/core-web-vitals, we will turn this into an array and add next and eslint/recommended

```
{
  "extends": [
    "next",
    "next/core-web-vitals",
    "eslint:recommended"
  ]
}
```

When using react version 17 or newer, the React object is global, so you no longer need to import it in the scope of your components; to tell the linter that it does not need to warn us that we are using a variable that is not defined, we will add React it to the "globals" key:

```
{
  "globals": {
    "React": "readonly"
  }
}
```

Lastly, we will add an entry for rules, where we can manually turn on/off different rules we like / don't like. For example, we can set the no-unused-vars to X (0 = ok, 1 = warning, 2 = error) and make it ignore variables prefixed with "\_":

```
{
  "rules": {
    "no-unused-vars": [1, { "args": "after-used", "argsIgnorePattern": "^_" }]
  }
}
```

### Prettier

For code formatting, we will install prettier as a dev dependency.

```
yarn add -D prettier
```

With VS Code it is also highly recommended to use the prettier extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode, which will allow your editor to automatically format the code (e.g. on save), instead of relying on the command line tool.

##### .prettierignore

Used to set patterns of files and folders that we do not prettier to format:

```
.yarn
.next
dist
node_modules
```

##### .prettierrc

Can also be named .prettierrc.json, used to create rules for formatting code. Like thie .prettierignore, this file will also be used by both the "prettier" command, and the vs code plugin.

```
{
  "trailingComma": "all",
  "tabWidth": 4,
  "semi": false,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "printWidth": 120,
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": ["*.json", ".prettierrc"],
      "options": {
        "tabWidth": 2
      }
    },
    {
      "files": ["paths.ts", "apis.ts", "urls.ts"],
      "options": {
        "printWidth": 140
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Add command to package.json

Adding amd running this script to the package.json file will enforce the code formatting rules (.prettierrc) on all files, except the ignored ones (.prettierignore). The --write flag is used to also save the files after changing them, and the . means to run in the whole project directory:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "prettier": "prettier --write ."
  }
}
```

##### Personal settings.json file

I presonally have this configuration in my settings.json file, I prefer to only format on save and not on paste/type, and I also use a plugin called "Formatting Toggle" https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tombonnike.vscode-status-bar-format-toggle, for situations where I need to turn off formatOnX (only the values in "formattingToggle.affects" will be affected, formatOnSave in my case as it is the only one that is't always set to false). Setting "prettier.requireConfig" to true will also only format projects that have a .prettierrc file, and not just everything.

```
{
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.formatOnPaste": false,
  "editor.formatOnType": false,
  "formattingToggle.affects": ["formatOnSave"],
  "prettier.requireConfig": false, // Only format projects with Prettier config file
  "editor.tabSize": 4, // In sync with value from .prittierrc file
}
```
