# Jet's Island

Setetup steps for next js application from scratch and online business "Jet's Island" presentation.

## Architecture

This section will include all steps and packages needed to setup the codebase.

### Installation

First, the next.js project needs to be initialized. Make sure you have node installed locally, then run the create-next-app command with the --ts flag, for TypeScript. You can also add the . if you wish to install in the current folder, instead of creating a new one.

```
npx create-next-app@latest --ts .
```

### Engine locking

First, we will define the fact that this project is designed to be built and run with yarn (the default for create-next-app, instead of npm). We already initialized the project with yarn during the initial step, and a .yarnlock file was autogenerated.

##### .npmrc

We will create a .npmrc file, where we specify that the engine that we defined (yarn / npm) must strictly be used when workgin with this project

```
engine-strict=true
```

##### .nvmrc

We will create a .nvmrc to clarify which version of node we are using

```
v16.13.1
```

Depending on your needs, you may need to use an older node version (e.g. if you want to deploy on something like vercel, you may need to use a speciffic or older node version)

##### "engines" field to package.json

Add the following engine to the package.json file; with this engine locking in place, if someone tries to run 'npm install', which could create a package.lock file and cause conflicts, an error will be thrown.
